### Hello, مرحباً 🙋‍♂️

```ts
const WebDeveloper = {
  experience: [ "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Html", "Css", "NodeJs", "ReactJs" ]
}

const Larose = {
  experience: [ "Python", "Java", "C#" ],
  ...WebDeveloper,
}

const learn = (thing: string) => Larose.experience.push(thing);

setTimeout(() => learn("React Native"), (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 31));
setTimeout(() => learn("Rust"), (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 61));
```

## 👩‍💻 this is how i like my code be like
- simple not complex code.
- short.
- readable.
- divided.
- short & clear variable. ( no numbers just words and _, $ )
- camelCase syntax.
- comments only when needed to explain something confuse or not readable.

## 😠 i hate
- a lot of code in one block-scope or file.
- i hate a lot of ( if... else ) statement. 
- long condition.
